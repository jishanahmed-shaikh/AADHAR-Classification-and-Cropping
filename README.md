# AADHAR Classification and Cropping 🆔📸

This project aims to automate the classification and cropping of AADHAR card images using a trained deep learning model. It provides tools to detect, classify, and verify the authenticity of AADHAR cards using PyTorch and Keras.

---

## 🔧 Features
- 📄 Detect and classify AADHAR card images using a ResNet model.
- ✂️ Crop the relevant sections from the card automatically.
- ✅ Includes average prediction logic for improved accuracy.
- 🧠 Pretrained models included (`Card_Detector_ResNet.keras` & `best.pt`).
